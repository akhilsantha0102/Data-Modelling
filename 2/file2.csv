A brand new product, which is useless now. Sure, I suppose I could go back to the store but all I would find there are long lines and unmotivated employees. I am continuously  disappointment with the giant food stores, so much that I refuse to visit your deli and seafood departments because the service is so poor.  Additionally, the shelves are never stocked and the check out lines are never occupied by any employees. The one lonely line that may be open is typically wrapped around the store. I wish I didn't have to shop at the giant, but it is the closest food store in my area. I spend a great deal of money in your store each month, but cringe when I walk through the door. Please do something to improve your customer service. Hire people who want to work and staff your priority departments (deli,meats, seafood). Have an optimal number of check out lines open during prime shopping times (weekends,evenings).  Ensure your shelves are stocked, with products that you can stand by (not expired or defective ones). 
I hope this provides you with some guidance to help improve your company and stores.

If they have changed the formula, it is a bad idea.  Also, they should put on the label hot and spicy.  This bottle tasted like cajun spice had been added.

I have also been to the Bailey's Crossroads Store and the Annandale Giant. For the past 3 weeks, I have been visiting them all looking for your dishwasher detergent.

I need Giant Dishwasher Detergent and the only thing on your shelves are  Cascade products which do not work well in our dishwasher. 

We have used Giant brand dishwasher detergent in our machines for many years with uninterrupted availability. Has your source dried up? Is the manufacturer temporarily closed for repackaging or cleaning? Did the person who orders the product go on vacation and forget to make an order? Or has Cascade just rented the space usually occupied by Giant Dishwasher Detergent? 

Please let me know what store may have this product at your earliest convenience. Thank you for looking into this matter.

I also got a box of the Giant Ginger Snaps because you only have your brand now. I got home and cut the onions, 1 was totally rotten and the other I could only use part of it. I opened the cookies that night and the one sleeve was torn so the cookies were exposed and soggy. That was the last straw. I'm so upset. It's like no one cares about this store or something. The manager tries, but she can't change what she gets supplied. Either the person checking what comes in has no idea what they're doing or someone is trying to sabotage this store. Also there's so many products that I use to buy all the time that you've stopped carrying, but yet your competition carries it. Safeway is right down the street.

I'm done, your product is absolutely appalling rotten strawberries every time, green bananas always, rotting mandarins so bad that they are dripping and moldy.  let's move on to you're way overpriced shitty meat selection,  you guys could not recognize a decent cut of beef if it slapped you,  ground beef is always about to pass the sale date, as I said I'm done I will shop elsewhere because it is obvious that you are overcharging cape-cod residents ( what did we do to you ?) just because there are tourist dollars here to collect .  I am not interested in paying for your losses incurred during the labor strike that you caused yourselves, and I don't care if a bunch of Dutch a**holes lose money trying to reshape the U.S. economy. I will from now on take my hard earned U.S. dollars elsewhere. 
P.S. thanks also for the rotten sausages that had me running to the toilet all weekend, I have to take some Imodium and go to bed early so I don't have to call in sick at work.
Have a great life, we won't be back.

Knowing that the plastic it's wrapped up is not biodegradeable, will harm wildlife, plants, and all of us.  Many ppl who eat organics feel this way.

Beats Heinz and Delmonte.  Last week, tried a new bottle and it was terrible.  If they don't go back to the original formula will not buy it anymore.  As the saying goes, If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  The reason he liked it was b/c the flavor was very mild, mellow and easily palatable.  Now it is hot and spicy and burns your mouth.  If they have changed the formula, it is a bad idea.  Also, they should put on the label hot and spicy.  This bottle tasted like cajun spice had been added.Also, the mgnt at this store is not good.  Does a very poor job of stocking the shelves.  NP crackers have been oos for weeks.  Also, always out of Pure Leaf iced tea Extra sweet.  Also, does not like Marty.
